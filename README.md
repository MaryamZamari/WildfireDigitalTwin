# WildfireDigitalTwin

This repository holds the scripts for my thesis project done with Google Earth Engine platform, to calculate the burned areas using NBR index, Burn Severity (dNBR) and Vegetation Recovery trend (NDVI) over time for the wildfire event of 2017 in Susa Valley. 
The "affected Area" is obtained from the CEMS rapid mapping service activated for the event.
